From August 2016 to May 2016, I was part of the Slipchenko research group at Purdue University developing a website and database for EFP calculations.

This website was hosted at [this location](http://dhcpa211.chem.purdue.edu/) and sometimes [this one](http://www.efpdb.org). The source can be found on [my Github](https://github.com/wgpierce/EFPDB).
