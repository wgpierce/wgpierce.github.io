I am a computer science and mathematics major at Purdue University.
I also take many computer engineering classes and some physics classes.
I focus on system software and the hardware-software interface, and like understanding systems from the ground up.
I am set to become a system software engineer at Nvidia in Summer 2018.

See my [projects](/projects) page for a list of my personal projects.

Check out my [github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}) page for the source of my projects and my programming projects.
For plagiarism purposes, I cannot post the source code from my Purdue classes. If you would like to have a look, contact me.
