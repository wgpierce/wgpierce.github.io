This seems to be some sort of place to write things..hmm


Here's a a sampling of some chemistry projects I did senior year of high school

The Chemical Chameleon
----------------------
The reaction proceeds as follows:

In solution, NaOH and Sucrose<br>
MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>  --> MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> --> MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> --> MnO<sub>2</sub>

*with more intermediates*

The sucrose is oxidized and slowly reduces the purple permanganate ion to 
the green tetraoxidomanganate ion to the blue hypomanganate ion to solid 
brown manganese dioxide, which is yellow in supspension
